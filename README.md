Predicting Lung Cancer Risk: A Statistical Analysis Based on Demographic and Health Factors.
Lung cancer is a prevalent and life-threatening disease with a profound global impact. Early detection and accurate risk prediction are pivotal in mitigating its consequences. This study presents a statistical analysis aimed at predicting lung cancer risk by leveraging demographic and health-related factors. The research unfolds in three specific objectives:
Objective 1: Develop a Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Model.
•	Utilizing logistic regression, a predictive model is established. The model considers factors such as age, gender, smoking history, and various health-related indicators. The performance of the model is assessed to gauge its effectiveness.
Objective 2: Identify Key Risk Factors.
•	A multivariate analysis is conducted to identify the most significant risk factors associated with lung cancer. This objective delves into understanding the relative importance of each factor.
Objective 3: Risk Stratification and Recommendation.
•	Individuals are stratified into risk categories (high, moderate, and low) based on their predicted risk scores. Specific recommendations are provided for each risk category, aiding in tailored prevention and early intervention strategies.
The findings of this study have the potential to contribute significantly to the field of lung cancer risk prediction, improving the identification of at-risk individuals and guiding targeted prevention measures. By focusing on the intersection of demographic and health factors, this research offers valuable insights into enhancing public health initiatives for lung cancer prevention.
